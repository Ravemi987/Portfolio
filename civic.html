          As I arrived at ENSEEIHT at the beginning of September, I did not valide any civic engagement
          just yet, though I have cool projects and ideas in mind. This includes taking part in the technical
          association Net7,the computer sience's association of the school, as well as participating in several
          challenges or events organised by industrial companies such as Thales and this way representing the school, and finally
          attending conferences.

              Net7 is the the assocation of the school gathering all the passionate of computer science and
              programmers. They develop and maintain students' services, coordinate formations and events, 
              coding and cybersecurity challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
              Especially, I want to be part of Pony7, the cybersecurity subclub of Net7.
              In fact, cybersecurity is one of my top favorite domain in computer science, 
              alongside embedded systems programming and artificial intelligence.
              This would be a great occasion to try CTF (Capture The Flag), discover Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
              and attend to multiple conferences led by alumni or professionals. I could also possibly set up simple
              practical formations myself about programming in cybersecurity, as I accumulated a certain knowledge thanks
              to my Bachelor's Degree at the University of Toulouse.
            </p>

            <p>
              With this commitment, I aim to promote the school, help other students and
              strengthen my academic profile to open up more opportunities,
              such as integrate the cybersecurity "TLS-SEC" selective curriculum in third year.

              BattleDev is a programmaming competition organised by Thales, with a $1000 cashprize.
              As one the first ten registrants, I have been invited by Thales themselves to compete on-site ! 
              I am very excited to meet new people and talk with professionals of their projects,
              since I am interested in joining Thales is the next few years.

              Like many students, I will take any opportunity to participate in theater plays,
              music representations, sportive activities, interviews and more, in order to discover
              the rich assiociative life at ENSEEIHT
