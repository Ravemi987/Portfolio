            Being enrolled at ENSEEIHT directly in the second year, I don't have to find an internship abroad.
            On the other hand, I cannot carry out an academic exchange either, as I must stay at least three semesters at the school, without considering the last semester, reserved for an internship or a final-year project in France.
          </p>

            Considering my interest in defense and aeronautics, it might be wise to simply prioritize an internship in France's industry leaders such as Thales, Airbus, Dassault, Ariane, and so on. It would allow me to successfully immerse myself into an industry requiring high-level clearance, led by strict standards, and whose projects are developed over many years.
          </p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            Still, I would love to go abroad in my life, even after my studies, and I have already prepared a mobility project. It gives the opportunity to sharpen English skills and discover new cultures.
